Hello,

This task was pretty straightforward for me. I would say the only challenge I faced was brainstorming the data structure I wanted to use to contain the items. After thinking of this case as a matrix, everything made a lot more sense. Moving items left and right was very straightforward including deleting items if they are on the ends.

My only issue was with testing, as I don't have much experience doing unit tests. I didn't create one for this example, but I would love to learn more about unit tests and its benefits.

I've tested all the edge cases with one stage, or no stages, and I haven't had any errors. I've also tested with using the same exact item name.

Overall, this was a fun practice test, and I learned a bit more about typescript events including left and right click events.
